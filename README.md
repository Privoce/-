[中文版介绍](./README.zh.md)

## What is this?

A personalized cloud browser portal composed with web apps—yes, each component is a web app itself.

Web app version: [https://nicegoodthings.com/](http://nicegoodthings.com/)

Browser Extension version: [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/portal-home-of-your-web-a/ccegbnlnelhgaefimiaklaindffpfcmh?hl=en&authuser=1)

Also, feel free to host your own version locally, or use the released extension locally.

## How is it different?

Our intrinsic value is openness, which can be demonstrated by 3P:

Portable: identity layer, application layer, hosting layer—all three layers are decoupled, which make data portable and the platform more decentralized than popular Web 2.0 era platforms.

Pure: no ads, no undesired system component, all contents are under your control.

Personalized: all components are chosen by you—you can drag them around anywhere you want, and you can store the changes on the personal cloud we provide by registering a Privoce Web ID, or just use local storage and keep all data local to your device.
